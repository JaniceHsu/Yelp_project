#####Predicted labels with multinomial NB classifier:
Good food.  Unique drinks.  Possibly the best ambi -> 1, 1
Natt Spil is up there as one of my favorite places -> 1, 1
No name outfront, dark and uninviting, but it is v -> 1, 1
We were a party of 4 on a very busy Saturday night -> 0, 0
Writing bad reviews makes me nervous, especially w -> 1, 0
